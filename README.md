# üß† Wayfinder OS

**A Live Neural Map of a Poetic Systems Engineer**

Wayfinder OS is an interactive web demo that visualizes the lived experience of a neurodivergent mind. It turns emotional states into immersive, shareable insight through animated brain regions, state toggles, and poetic tooltips.

## ‚ú® Features

- **State Toggles**: Switch between `Flow`, `Anxious`, `Sad`, and `Shutdown` modes.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Brain regions and neural pathways animate in response to the selected state.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Click on any region to learn about its function and metaphorical role.
- **Poetic Tooltips**: Hover any region to see its metaphorical description.
- **State-Driven Behaviors**:
  - **Anxious**: Amygdala glows and pulses, overall activity is heightened.
  - **Flow**: Frontal lobes are highlighted, with smooth, connected energy patterns.
  - **Sad**: The Default Mode Network (DMN) is more prominent, colors are muted.
  - **Shutdown**: Overall brain activity is significantly dimmed.
- **Bun-Powered**: Fast startup and development with Bun, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Our goal is to create a deeply interactive and educational experience. The current sprint focuses on:

1.  **Implementing State-Driven Animations**: Bringing the brain to life with dynamic visuals for each state.
2.  **Displaying Region Information**: Adding a panel to show details about selected brain regions.
3.  **Code Refactoring**: Ensuring the codebase remains clean and maintainable.

See the full [Sprint Plan](./docs/sprint-plan.md) for more details.

## üîß Development & Quality Assurance

This project includes comprehensive safeguards to prevent shipping broken code:

### Package Scripts

#### Development Scripts
```bash
# Start development server
bun run dev

# Run tests in watch mode (tight inner dev loop)
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with UI
bun run test:ui

# Type checking
bun run type-check
```

#### Testing Scripts
```bash
# Run all tests once
bun run test:run

# Run tests with coverage report
bun run test:coverage

# CI-optimized test run with verbose output
bun run test:ci
```

#### Code Quality Scripts
```bash
# Lint code and report issues
bun run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
bun run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
bun run format

# Check if code is properly formatted
bun run format:check
```

#### CI/CD Scripts
```bash
# Pre-commit validation (type-check + lint + format + test)
bun run pre-commit

# Full CI pipeline (type-check + lint + test + build)
bun run ci
```

### Code Quality Tools

#### ESLint Configuration
- **TypeScript** support with `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- **React** rules with `eslint-plugin-react` and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
- **Accessibility** checks with `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`
- **Prettier** integration for consistent formatting
- Custom rules for code quality and best practices

#### Prettier Configuration
- Automatic code formatting on save (VS Code)
- Consistent style across the codebase
- Integration with ESLint to avoid conflicts

#### Testing Setup
- **Vitest** for fast unit testing
- **@testing-library/react** for component testing
- **jsdom** environment for DOM testing
- **Coverage reports** with 80% thresholds
- Support for async testing with `@testing-library/user-event`

### VS Code Integration

#### Auto-formatting
- Format on save enabled
- ESLint auto-fix on save
- Consistent tab size and spacing

#### Recommended Extensions
- ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)
- Prettier (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)
- Tailwind CSS (`bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss`)
- Vitest (`vitest.explorer`)
- Bun (`oven.bun-vscode`)

### GitHub Actions CI/CD

The project includes a comprehensive CI pipeline that:
- ‚úÖ **Type checks** with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ **Lints** code with ESLint
- ‚úÖ **Validates** formatting with Prettier
- ‚úÖ **Runs tests** with coverage reporting
- ‚úÖ **Builds** the production bundle
- ‚úÖ **Uploads** coverage to Codecov
- ‚úÖ **Archives** build artifacts

#### Coverage Thresholds
- **Branches**: 80%
- **Functions**: 80%
- **Lines**: 80%
- **Statements**: 80%

### Development Workflow

1. **Before committing**: Run `bun run pre-commit`
2. **During development**: Use `bun run test:watch` for instant feedback
3. **Before pushing**: Ensure CI passes with `bun run ci`
4. **Code reviews**: GitHub Actions will validate all changes
